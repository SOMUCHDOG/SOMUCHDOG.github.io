	"content": "ABC Stories was a team project developed by the GIMM Department and funded by The Old Coot & Maggie Foundation. 
	We were asked to create an application to help children on the autistic spectrum improve and learn handwriting.

	ABC Stories utilizes iOS technology to deliver an immersive Augmented Reality experience to engage children in a new type of learning environment. This technology also allows more understanding for parents and occupational therapists, as it tracks the players progress and displays it on the dashboard website, ABCStories.org. 

My contributions to the development are primarily on the network and back-end development of the application and systems. I developed the API, authentication, and data collection functionality. Utilizing Amazon Web Services, MongoDB, Swift, and Javascript to create a way for the app to send data from the app to a remotely hosted server to be displayed to users with the correct permissions.

Boise State University decided that they did not want to host the storage for the application data, so it was handed off to the company Blocksmith Inc. to manage the data.",
